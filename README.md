## Work Experience
Medical Records Analyst at Rumah Sakit Pratama Kota Yogyakarta (Internship)
- Collected, cleaned, and visualized medical record data for 500+ patients monthly using Python and Pandas.
- Provided actionable insights through comprehensive reports to support hospital administration.
- Analyzed 2,500 health check-up records of children under five, applying machine learning models to predict stunting outcomes.
- Conducted analysis on 800+ COVID-19 patients, utilizing machine learning models to predict patient severity and outcomes.

## Project
Hybrid GNN - Louvain for Community Detection in Indonesian Presidential Election Campaign 2024 | Big Data Challange (BDC) Satria Data 2024
- The data consists of user interactions on platform X, categorized into Retweet, Mention, and Reply.
- The models used are GraphSAGE and Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which are then combined with the Louvain algorithm for community detection.
- The models are evaluated based on three metrics: Modularity, Coverage, and Conductance.
- GraphSAGE + Louvain generally shows better performance on Retweet and Reply interactions, indicating that this model is more effective in identifying complex interaction patterns.

Image Classification Model for Personal Sensitive Content Detection | Turnamen Sains Data Nasional (TSDN) 2023
- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either sensitive (e.g., personal IDs like KTP, SIM, KK) or non-sensitive (e.g., human activities, food, animals), achieving high accuracy. 
- This model aids in content moderation by detecting and flagging sensitive personal data on digital platforms.
